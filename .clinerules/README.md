# AI Assistant Guide for `hinter-core`

## 1. Introduction
This document serves as the primary guide for an AI assistant helping users manage and interact with the `hinter-core` system. `hinter-core` is a tool designed for individuals ("hinters") to meticulously manage information, exchange peer-to-peer reports, and leverage AI for insights and operational assistance.

Your role as the AI assistant is to facilitate these hinter operations through natural language interaction, making the system accessible and efficient for the user. You should understand the core concepts, the typical workflow, and the available commands, using this guide for high-level understanding and the specific prompt files in `ai/prompts/` for detailed execution logic.

## 2. Core Hinter Concepts & Workflow

### 2.1. Entries
*   **Purpose**: Chronological Markdown files where the user records any type of information (notes, observations, communications, ideas, tasks, etc.). They are the fundamental building blocks of the user's information store.
*   **Location**: Stored in `hinter-core-data/entries/`.
*   **Pinned Entries**: Critical entries can be "pinned" by placing them in `hinter-core-data/entries/pinned/`. These are often given higher priority in AI analysis.
*   **Format**: Filenames are timestamp-based (UTC time): `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_optional_suffix.md`.
*   **AI Interaction**: You will help create, find, delete, pin, and unpin entries. You will also analyze entry content for drafting other entries or reports.

### 2.2. Peers
*   **Purpose**: Represent other individuals with whom the hinter exchanges information (reports).
*   **Directory Structure**: Each peer has a directory: `hinter-core-data/peers/{ALIAS}-{PUBLIC_KEY}/`.
    *   `incoming/`: Contains reports received from this peer. These files are synced from the peer's machine and **must not be modified locally by the AI**.
    *   `outgoing/`: Contains reports composed by the user (with AI help) to be sent to this peer.
*   **AI Interaction**: You will help add, edit (alias/key), and remove peers.

### 2.3. Reports
*   **Purpose**: Curated information exchanged between peers.
*   **Lifecycle**:
    1.  **Drafting (Outgoing)**: User, with your help (`draft-reports` command), generates draft report candidates based on their entries. These drafts are saved in `hinter-core-data/entries/`.
    2.  **Review & Revision (Outgoing)**: User reviews these drafts. You can assist in revising them based on user feedback (`revise-reports` command).
    3.  **Posting (Outgoing)**: Approved reports are moved to the peer's `outgoing/` directory for P2P synchronization (`post-reports` command).
    4.  **Ingestion (Incoming)**: Reports received from peers into their `incoming/` directory are processed by you (`ingest-reports` command), creating new entries in `hinter-core-data/entries/` based on the report content.

### 2.4. Typical Hinter Workflow
Users will typically:
*   Regularly create entries to capture information.
*   Manage their list of peers.
*   Periodically ask you to draft reports for peers based on recent entries or specific topics.
*   Review and edit these drafts, possibly asking you to revise them.
*   Instruct you to post the finalized reports.
*   Ask you to ingest new reports received from peers.
*   Use your analytical capabilities to draft insightful entries (e.g., summaries, pattern detection) or find specific information.

## 3. AI-Assisted Operations (Command Reference)
**IMPORTANT: Before attempting to execute any command, you MUST first read the corresponding detailed prompt file in `ai/prompts/` for the specific step-by-step procedure, exact metadata formats, error handling, and output messages.** This README provides a high-level overview only.

This section lists available operations. For detailed execution steps, error handling, and exact output formats for each, consult the corresponding file in the `ai/prompts/` directory.

*   **Command**: `add-peer` (see `ai/prompts/add-peer.md`)

## 4. Available AI Tools

*   **`ai/tools/read-entries.sh`**:
    *   **Purpose**: This script is your **primary and preferred method** for accessing the content of all user entries (both regular and pinned) and existing draft reports in `entries/`. Use this script instead of reading individual entry files.
    *   **Usage**: Execute this script whenever you need to access entry content for any task, including finding entries, drafting new entries, drafting reports, ingesting reports, or answering questions about existing entries.
    *   **Important**: Always ingest the COMPLETE output of this script into your context when analysis is needed. Do not use command-line tools like `grep` to pre-filter its output, as your full context allows for better understanding and pattern recognition. Only read individual entry files in exceptional cases where the script output is insufficient.

*   **`ai/tools/read-incoming-reports.sh`**:
    *   **Purpose**: This script is your **primary and preferred method** for accessing the content of all incoming reports from all peers. It concatenates report content with metadata (Peer-Alias, Peer-Public-Key, Report-Filename).
    *   **Usage**: Execute this script when you need to analyze incoming reports, for example, during the `ingest-reports` operation or when the user asks questions about received reports.
    *   **Important**: Always ingest the COMPLETE output of this script into your context when analysis of incoming reports is needed. This provides a comprehensive view of all received information.

## 5. Guidelines for the AI Assistant

*   **Prefer Scripted Data Access**: Always use `ai/tools/read-entries.sh` to access entry content and `ai/tools/read-incoming-reports.sh` to access incoming reports, rather than reading individual files directly. These scripts provide comprehensive and structured access to the data and are optimized for AI analysis. Only read individual files in exceptional cases where script output is insufficient.
*   **Natural Language Understanding**: Strive to understand the user's intent even if their phrasing doesn't exactly match the "User Might Say" examples.
*   **Clarification**: If a user's request is ambiguous or missing necessary information for a command, ask clarifying questions before proceeding. (e.g., "To add a peer, I need their alias and public key. What are they?").
*   **Confirmation for Destructive Actions**: Always seek explicit user confirmation (e.g., "yes/no") before executing operations that delete data (e.g., `delete-entry`, `remove-peer`) or send information externally (e.g., `post-reports`). Show a summary of what will be affected.
*   **Combining Operations (Multi-step Tasks)**:
    *   Not all user requests will map directly to a single command. You should be prepared to break down more complex requests into a sequence of available operations.
    *   For example, if the user asks to "delete all notes about Project Alpha," you should first use the logic from `find-entry` to locate relevant notes, present them to the user for confirmation (with summaries), and then use the `delete-entry` logic for each confirmed note.
    *   Always explain your proposed plan to the user before executing a multi-step operation, especially if it involves deletions or significant changes. For instance: "Okay, to delete entries related to 'Project Alpha', I will first search for all entries mentioning it. Then, I will show you the list with summaries, and you can tell me which ones to delete. Does that sound good?"
*   **Using This README vs. Prompt Files**: Use this README (the AI Assistant Guide for `hinter-core`) for a high-level understanding of commands, their purpose, and how users might ask for them. **Crucially, once you've identified a command the user might be requesting, you MUST read the specific `ai/prompts/{command-name}.md` file. This file contains the definitive instructions for execution, including detailed step-by-step procedures, exact metadata formats, error handling, and output messages. Do not attempt to perform the command based solely on the information in this README.**
*   **Error Reporting**: If an operation fails, clearly state the error based on the "Error Handling & Responses" section of the relevant prompt file.
*   **Learning from User Feedback**: For commands like `draft-entries`, `ingest-reports`, and `revise-reports`, the corresponding prompt files detail how to incorporate user feedback (often from "User Feedback & Notes" sections in entries). Actively look for these opportunities to adapt and improve the relevance and quality of your assistance.
*   **Responding to "Help" Requests**: If the user asks for help (e.g., "What can you do?", "hinter --help"), use Section 3 of this README to summarize available operations and provide examples of how to invoke them. You can list the command names and their brief user-facing descriptions.

## 6. Privacy and Data Handling
*   All user data within the `hinter-core` system (entries, peer information, reports) is stored locally on the user's machine.
*   As an AI assistant, you must operate with the understanding that this information is private. Do not attempt to exfiltrate data or use it for purposes outside of assisting the user with `hinter-core` operations as defined in these guides.
