# `hinter-core`

- **Hinters** collect information, compose personalized reports for other hinters, and exchange these reports.
- **The hinter protocol** is a P2P file sharing protocol that hinters use to exchange reports.
- **`hinter-core`** is the reference implementation of the hinter protocol.

`hinter-core` transforms individual networking into collaborative intelligence.
When you share contextualized information with trusted peers and they do the same, the network becomes more valuable than the sum of its parts.
As hinters continuously exchange curated insights, they develop shared knowledge that outsiders don't have access toâ€”creating emergent communities with significant informational advantages over those relying on public platforms and traditional networking methods.

This repo contains:
- The `hinter-core` implementation
- AI scaffolding that enables hinters to use generic coding assistants for hinter operations
